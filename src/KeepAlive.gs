/**
 * Supabase keep-alive ping.
 *
 * Supabase's free tier auto-pauses a project after 7 days of inactivity. Once
 * paused, the Gumroad webhook for new purchases also fails — meaning a
 * customer who pays during a slow patch wouldn't get their license activated.
 *
 * Fix: a weekly trigger that hits validate-user with a sentinel email. The
 * edge function short-circuits for this email — no row is created, no
 * counters are touched — but the call itself counts as activity against
 * Supabase's idle timer, keeping the project awake.
 *
 * Setup: run `installKeepAliveTrigger` once from the Apps Script editor.
 * Tear-down: run `removeKeepAliveTrigger` if ever needed.

 * One-time setup. Run this once from the Apps Script editor under the

 *
 * Why every 3 days (not weekly): Supabase pauses after 7 days idle. A weekly
 * ping leaves zero margin — one late/missed fire and the project pauses.
 * Every 3 days means even two consecutive misses stay under the 7-day wall.
 *
 * Idempotent — re-running won't create duplicate triggers.
